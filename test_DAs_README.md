test_DAs.cpp and test_DAs_gnuplot allows CN coins to test and compare DA algorithms on Linux. 
You have to have gnuplot to see the outputs.
To modify the settings for the simulations, go to main() at the bottom og test_DAs.cpp.
The output charts can be easily seen by opening test_DAs.html after the simulation is run.
